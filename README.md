A collection basic templates repeatedly used in developing GoFiber website backends

Remember to initialize the mod file:
```
$ go mod init <name of project/githublink>
```
When you make package changes, run the following command; to sync your packages:
```
$ go get -u
$ go mod tidy
```
Some say that ```go get -u``` is more agressive than ```go mod tidy``` but Im not best to comment on that.
